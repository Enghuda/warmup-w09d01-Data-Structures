# Data Structures

## Arrays
###Definition:
Array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations to
store multiple items of the same type together.
###How its work:
####Insertion Operation:
insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.
####Deletion Operation:

####Search Operation:
You can perform a search for an array element based on its value or its index.
####Update Operation:
Update operation refers to updating an existing element from the array at a given index.
###Complexity:
the best case time is O(1)
the worst case time is O(n)
the average case time is O(n)

## Queues
###Definition:
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 
###Complexity:
O(n)
